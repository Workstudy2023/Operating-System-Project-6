Memory Management Simulation Project

Overview

This project simulates a basic memory management system in an operating system. It consists of two main components: the Operating System Supervisor (parent.c) and the child processes (child.c). The simulation handles memory requests, page faults, and inter-process communication using shared memory and message queues.

Features

Simulated Clock: Uses shared memory to simulate a system clock.
Inter-Process Communication: Utilizes message queues for communication between parent and child processes.
Memory Management: Includes a frame table for memory allocation and a process control block for each child process.
Logging and Statistics: Records events and calculates statistics like memory accesses and page faults.

Command Line Arguments

-f: Specify the logfile name.
-n: Total number of child processes oss will ever launch.
-s: Maximum number of concurrent running processes.
-t: Time to launch new child processes.
-h: Display help information.

Functionality

Parent Process (oss): Manages the shared memory, frame table, and handles requests from child processes.
Child Process: Generates memory access requests and communicates with the parent process.

Message Queues: Used for sending memory requests and receiving responses.
Shared Memory: Stores the simulated clock and is accessed by both parent and child processes.
Handling Page Faults

The system logs all important events to a specified logfile and prints memory and process statistics.
